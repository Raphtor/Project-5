Also pretty simple. Just a version of kruskal's algorithm. 

It has time complexity O(kN^2) because (ironically) the 
printing part has two loops with N iterations. 

Kruskal's algorithm has a complexity of O(kMN) because the
outer loop (while(!edges.isEmpty()) iterates M times, while 
the inner loop (for (TreeSet<Node> tsn : nodes)) iterates 
(at maximum) N times.

P5B_README
This was really simple. I just read the file and increased the frequency in a table by
1 every time an airport was a departure or an arrival. The order of the airports was
determined by the order of the original airports. These corresponded to the index of the
table.

Has time complexity O(kN^2) because of the printing function.
